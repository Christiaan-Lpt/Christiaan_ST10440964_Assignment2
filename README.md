Introduction
The Tamagotchi App is a virtual pet simulation game designed for Android devices, inspired by the popular 1990s virtual pet toy, Tamagotchi. The app allows users to care for a virtual pet by feeding, cleaning, and playing with it to keep it happy and healthy.

Purpose of the App
The main purpose of the app is to provide users with an engaging and nostalgic experience of caring for a virtual pet, reminiscent of the original Tamagotchi toy. Through interactive gameplay and real-time monitoring of the pet's status, users can develop a sense of responsibility and attachment to their virtual pet.

Design Considerations
User Interface (UI) Design
The app features a visually appealing and intuitive user interface designed to enhance user engagement and enjoyment. Key design considerations include:

Engaging welcome screen: The welcome screen features a warm welcome message and an image of the virtual pet to create a welcoming atmosphere for users.

Main screen layout: The main screen displays the virtual pet's image along with buttons for feeding, cleaning, and playing. The layout is designed for easy navigation and interaction.

Dynamic pet images: The pet's image changes according to the action performed by the user, adding a level of interactivity and realism to the gameplay experience.

Logic Implementation![image](https://github.com/Christiaan-Lpt/Christiaan_ST10440964_Assignment2/assets/164025506/fefdf2cc-fc60-4a28-b77f-ebc31e0ddeb6)

The app's logic is implemented using Kotlin programming language within Android Studio. Key logic considerations include:

Button functionalities: Each button on the main screen (feed, clean, play) triggers specific actions that affect the pet's status values (health, hunger, cleanliness, happiness).

Status value updates: The app dynamically updates the pet's status values based on user actions and simulates the pet's needs and conditions over time.

GitHub integration: The app is integrated with GitHub for version control and collaboration, allowing for efficient code management and sharing.

Testing and Automated Testing
Thorough manual testing has been conducted to verify the app's functionality and ensure smooth operation. Testing includes:

Verifying user interactions: Ensuring smooth transitions between screens and responsive button actions.
Status value validation: Verifying accurate updating of status values based on user actions and time progression.
GitHub Actions: Automated testing is facilitated through GitHub Actions, which run tests and build the code to ensure reliability and compatibility across different environments and devices.
GitHub Repository
